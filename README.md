# TableauCounter
Counts the number of set-valued Young Tableaux of a given shape and weight set

To use, edit the Tableau.txt file by representing each entry with a number where that number corresponds to weight of that entry.
Use the -w arguement when running from command line to save each tableau to a text file (output.txt).
